## Introduction

The **Code Rating Predictor** is a mini project that leverages the power of machine learning to predict a user's rating on one competitive programming platform based on their rating on another. Specifically, this project uses data from CodeChef and Codeforces to create a predictive model using linear regression.

With a dataset of 11,000 users' ratings, the project demonstrates the practical application of data science and web development to create a useful tool for competitive programmers.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses linear regression to predict ratings.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
- **User-Friendly**: Enter a rating from one platform to get the predicted rating on the other.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-rating-predictor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd code-rating-predictor
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy 
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and machine learning model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook rating_predictor.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the notebook cells to see the data processing, visualization, and model training steps.
3. To use the web interface, open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

### Example
- Enter your CodeChef rating to get a predicted Codeforces rating.
- Enter your Codeforces rating to get a predicted CodeChef rating.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling user input and displaying predictions.
- `rating_predictor.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and model creation.
- `data.csv`: The dataset containing 11,000 users' ratings from CodeChef and Codeforces.
